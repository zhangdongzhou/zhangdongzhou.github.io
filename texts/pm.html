			Minerals are natural crystals whose atoms are highly ordered. The typical dimension of a mineral's unit cell is in the order of picometer.
			X-ray diffraction is one of the most popular techniques to determine the crystal structure of minerals. At PX^2, I focus on single crystal
			and powder X-ray diffraction at a variety of pressure/temperature/chemical conditions. Our beamline is a world-leading 
			synchrotron beamline in the field of crystal structure solution.
