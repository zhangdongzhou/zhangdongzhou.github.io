			Meter is the typical dimension of a mineral physicist, who prepare the sample,
			carry out the experiments, analyze the data and write the manuscripts. I feel lucky
			to be able to carry out my experiments in a state-of-the-art facility, so that I can 
			measure the properties of materials down to the size of atomic nuclei, and use the
			results to explore the interior of our earth and other planets.
