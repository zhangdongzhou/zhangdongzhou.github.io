			Meter is the typical dimension of a mineral physicist, who prepares the sample,
			carries out the experiments, analyzes the data, and writes the manuscripts. I am fortunate
			to be able to carry out my experiments in a state-of-the-art facility, where I can 
			measure the properties of materials down to the size of atomic nuclei, and use the
			results to explore the interiors of our earth and other planets.
