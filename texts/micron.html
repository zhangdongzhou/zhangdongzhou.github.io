			Pressure is  proportional to the force applied to the sample, and inversely proportional to the contact area. 
			In order to reach high pressures at a given force, one can shrink the sample size. A typical
			dimension of the sample in megabar diamond anvil cell experiment ranges from 1 to 100 Î¼m.
