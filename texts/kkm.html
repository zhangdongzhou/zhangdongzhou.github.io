			Trained as a geophysicist, I am interested in the interior structure, dynamics,
			and evolution of terrestrial planets. Most terrestrial planets' diameters are in
			the order of 1000 km. Their interior pressure and temperature can reach hundreds of GPa
			and thousands of Kelvin. Understanding the phase relations, thermodynamical properties, and mechanical 
			characteristics of materials under the planetary interior conditions helps people to determine
			the past, present and future states of planets.
