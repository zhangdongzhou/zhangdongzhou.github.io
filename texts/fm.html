			The diameter of atomic nucleus ranges from 1.6 to tens of fm. The interaction 
			between the nucleus and the surrounding electrons provides detailed information 
			about the material's vibrational and magnetic properties. I use a special technique 
			called nuclear resonant scattering (including MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy and nuclear resonant 
			inelastic X-ray scattering) to determine the phonon behavior, magnetic property and atomic dynamics 
			of minerals at different conditions.
