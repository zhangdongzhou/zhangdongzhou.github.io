			I have been using optical spectroscopy in my research for a few years. I use
			both visible light spectroscopy (Raman, fluorescence, infrared, Brillouin, black-body radiation, etc) and X-ray 
			spectroscopy (diffraction, radiography, inelastic scattering, MÃ¶ssbauer, X-ray fluorescence and X-ray absorption) in my research. 
			The typical wavelength of light that I use in my research covers a wide range from 0.001 nm to 1000 nm.
