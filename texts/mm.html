			There are several ways to simulate the high pressure, high temperature conditions
			of planetary interiors, and I often use a small device called the diamond anvil cell.
			It uses two ~0.2 carat diamonds with sharp tip to sqeeze the tiny sample, so as to 
			generate pressures up to several million times of the ambient atomspheric pressure. 
			Diamond is transparent to both visible light and X-ray, which provides opportunity
			for us to heat the sample with laser, and to measure the properties of the sample 
			<em>in-situ</em> using optical spectroscopy.
